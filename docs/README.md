# Exonum Python Light Client Documentation

Documentation for this library is generated via
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

To install Sphinx (from here it is assumed that you work inside venv and
`python` defaults to `python3` and `pip` defaults to `pip3`), run:

```sh
pip install sphinx
```

To build docs locally:

```sh
make html
```

To change the settings for Sphinx, edit [conf.py](conf.py).

To change the docs, edit appropriate `*.rst` file.

The entry point of the docs is `index.rst`.
